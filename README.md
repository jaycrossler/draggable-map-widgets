draggable-map-widgets
=====================

Widgets that host OpenLayers 2.12 maps, uses JQuery and Bootstrap for all page rendering. Allows maps to be moved and resized, and keeps configuration via a cookie.

Currently all in JavaScript, next step will likely be to add to a web framework like Django.

This repository contains a modified version of Bootstrap Plus Plus by getredhawkstudio (purchased on CodeCanyon.com for $6). Don't be a mooch, go buy it as well if you're going to use this commercially.
